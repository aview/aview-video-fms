	<!-- This section specifies virtual directory mappings for resources -->

	<!-- the location specified by the virtual directory mapping. To     -->
	<!-- specify a virtual directory mapping, you first specify the      -->

		<!-- This maps all streams whose virtual			 -->
		<!-- key matches the listed key, if given and	 		 -->
		<!-- names begin with "foo/" to the physical directory c:\data.  -->
		<!-- For example, the stream named "foo/bar" would map to the    -->

		<!-- stream named "foo/bar/x", then we first try to find a vdir  -->
		<!-- mapping for "foo/bar". Failing to do so, we then check for  -->
		<!-- a vdir mapping for "foo". Since there is one, the stream    -->
		<!-- "foo/bar" corresponds to the file "c:\data\bar\x.flv".      -->
